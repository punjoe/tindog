## Description

This is a dating website made made for dogs based on the tinder layout. It was part of a module of the udemy course The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp


## What I have learned

This is my 1st website built after learning bootstrap, using grids, buttons and navbars.
Also making a website repsonsive to what size screen it is being viewed on.

The udemy course is being taught using bootstrap 4, however building this site I was using bootstrap 5. A lot was also learnt from the bootstrap 5 docs and various other sources as web3 schools and stackoverflow.
